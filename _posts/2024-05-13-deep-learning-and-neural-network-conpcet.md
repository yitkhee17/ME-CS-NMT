1. Concept:
   a. Neural network: A calculus model that imitates human nerve neurones used to analyse and learn. A neural network consists of interconnected neuron units. Each unit can conduct simple data analysis, and the information produced will be transferred to other interconnected units. 
   b. Deep Learning: A sub-field of machine learning that tries to imitate the working theory of the human brain, allowing the machine to self-learn and solve problems. The core of deep learning is a neural network, especially the deep neural network, which consists of many hidden layers and neural networks.

2. Applications: Voice recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, etc.
   
3. Real-world example: An application that can identify cats from the images.
   a. Analysis: Collect a large amount of images that contain cats and do not contain cats. Label them with 'cat' and 'none' tags, and save them as a dataset. Use the dataset to train the neural network model. The model will learn from the training data by adjusting the weight of interconnected units with the prediction result. A large training process will secure the prediction quality.
